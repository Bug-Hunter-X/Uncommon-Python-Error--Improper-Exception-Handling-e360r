This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error in Python, focusing on improper exception handling. The file 'bug.py' contains code that attempts to handle specific exceptions (ZeroDivisionError, TypeError), yet also uses a generic 'except Exception' clause. This broad exception handling can hide unexpected errors and impede debugging. The 'bugSolution.py' file provides a more robust solution.
